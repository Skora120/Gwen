## About Project
Version 1.0
Goal of this project is to make web application which will help schools at every level of education. Eventually lecturer will be able to: make groups for students, give them tasks, manage groups, give marks for tasks, download students submissions and see statistics. On the other hand student will be able to: join to groups, submit solution for tasks, receive notifications.
Application  is created with [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/) and TDD approach.

## Progress
Current progress is available to see at 'dev' branch. Currently I am focusing on Backend and the Frontend is being created but it is very basic, without any fancy features. Creating Vue components can take some time and I am now short on that.

## Features
Work in progress, there will be something by the first usable version.
